## Coder's Cove 🚀

To get an invite to the organization, join the [Coder's Cove](https://discord.gg/cWHnQFSfMy) Discord and @ `mattrltrent` or somebody with the `mod`/`admin` role and let them know you want an invite! This will allow you to see all the repos and interact with other members. Conversations usually reside in either the `#🤝-collabs` or project-specific channels for this organization.

Let's build some cool stuff together!
