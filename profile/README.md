## Coder's Cove 🚀

To get an invite to the organization, join the [Coder's Cove](https://discord.gg/cWHnQFSfMy) Discord and @ somebody with the `mod` role and let them know you want an invite! This will allow you to see all the repos and interact with other members. Conversations usually reside in the `#🤝-collabs` channel for this.

Let's build some cool stuff together!
